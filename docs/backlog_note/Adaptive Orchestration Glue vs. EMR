Backlog Note — Adaptive Orchestration (Future Enhancement)

Idea: Implement size-aware orchestration logic in Airflow to dynamically select Glue or EMR Spark based on input file size.
Goal: Demonstrate scalable, dependency-aware automation and highlight decision-driven orchestration.
Next Steps (future sprint):

Add S3 size check + BranchPythonOperator (threshold = 50 MB).

Record run state and engine in DynamoDB for idempotency.
